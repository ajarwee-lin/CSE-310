# Overview

As a software engineer, I am always looking to learn and grow. This simple "Hello World" program is a part of that journey. It's a small step, but every step counts!

This software is a simple program written in Python. Its purpose is to print the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. It's a classic first step when learning a new programming language or setting up a new development environment.
